Story of the game:
There was once a boy named Pac. He never liked to go to school because there were three 
bullies  that used to always trouble him. The bullies were Alex,James,Lucius and Tom. In this game, 
Pac tries to run and fight from the three Bullies by avoiding them as much as he can. But there's a twist!
As the game moves on the bullies get bigger and faster but there's the catch. Pac loves Apples and there will be apples spawning any where on the canvas which make pac a bit more faster. Enjoy Playing PacMan.

Try and avoid the bullies for as long as you can. Surviving 2 seconds fetches 5 points.

Characters of the game:
Pac(The Main Player)
Alex,James,Lucius and Tom(Bullies)
Apples(Helping Pac get better)

Rules of the game:
No rules, just play as much as you can and get the high score! Take as many apples you can and try to get as fast as you can. You can move Up,Down,Right,Left.

Feedback Of the Game:
Nothing complicated.. you get 5 points for surviving 2 seconds and -1 for a close call. Eating an Apple fetches 2 points too:)

The Game ends when you have touched any of the 3 bullies, which are in the colour of Orange,Red and Green. Also no walls, just the canvas so play freely. :)
